Network Security
Network security consists of the policies, processes, and practices adopted to prevent, detect, and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.

Key Goal: To protect the integrity and usability of your data while it is in transit.

Lab Connection: Demonstrated this by setting up communication between your Linux Mint, Kali, and Ubuntu virtual machines and verifying the link in Cisco Packet Tracer.


GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)
GRC is a structured approach to aligning IT with business goals while managing risks and meeting all industry and government regulations.

Governance: The set of rules and policies that dictate how an organization operates.

Risk: Identifying and mitigating technical or physical threats that could harm the organization.

Compliance: Ensuring the organization follows laws (like HIPAA or GDPR) and internal security standards.

Lab Connection: By organizing screenshots into a clean folder hierarchy and keeping repository Private, you are practicing GRC standards.


Cloud Security
Cloud security is a collection of security measures designed to protect cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and data. These measures ensure user and device authentication, data privacy, and resource access control.

Shared Responsibility: In the cloud, the provider (like AWS or Azure) secures the hardware, while the user (you) is responsible for securing the data and access permissions.

Lab Connection: The use of a GitHub repository to store and version-control  lab deliverables is a practical example of using cloud-based tools for security documentation.

Category,                               Competency Demonstrated
Linux Administration,                   Provisioned an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (AMD64) Server environment and managed system permissions using chmod.
Automation & Scripting,                 Authored and executed a Bash audit script to automate system health logs and file I/O operations.
Network Engineering,                    "Engineered a Star Topology using Cisco hardware, implementing static IPv4 addressing and verifying Layer 3 connectivity via ICMP."
Infrastructure-as-Code,                 Managed the technical supply chain by synchronizing local infrastructure artifacts to a remote GitHub repository using Git CLI.
Technical Troubleshooting,              Resolved ICMP timeouts (logical layer) and Git pathspec errors (directory context) through systematic debugging.


Linux Systems Administration: Provisioned an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS environment and automated system audits using Bash scripting.

Network Engineering: Designed a functional Star Topology and configured static IPv4 addressing within a Cisco environment.

Version Control & CI/CD: Managed the deployment pipeline by synchronizing local artifacts to a remote repository via Git CLI.
